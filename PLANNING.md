## Key Technologies:
`Django`
`Django allAuth`
`PostgreSQL`
`Bootstrap`

## Scope:
 A Travel app that will help a user plan and prepare for trips. I should be able to implement Weather API and user authentication with Django allAuth (for sign up with social network accounts). Tackling allAuth now will set me up for my stretch goals which are implementing Google Calendar, Maps as well as currency exchange to further assist in the user travel planning.

## User Stories:
As a user who likes to travel, in order to plan my next trip, when I am on the welcome page, I can choose to sign up or login. 
Once logged in, I can then start planning a new trip by inputting my trips destination and dates then clicking 'Add Trip'. 
Once a trip is added I can then click and view my trip and the weather so I can begin planning. 
When viewing a trip I can also add a budget as well as create a list by categories of my choosing and additionally add items to the list.
Once my trip is over I can then click 'End Trip' at the bottom to delete the trip.
